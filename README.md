# The-Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic
#Issue: Detecting if a patient with a given diagnostic suffers from Breast Cancer. 

#Data: The breast cancer Wisconsin dataset. 
#Trained Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-nearest Neighbor, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVC, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest and ExtraTrees Classifier. 
#Methods for Model Validation and Selection: The Cross Validation Score with 70 Folds, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 scores, and the AUC-ROC Curve. Result: The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm with the least square technique is the most effective model. Indeed, this selected model can predict whether a patient with given dialogistic suffers from breast cancer. Notably, it gives a very high accuracy of approximately 99 %. Furthermore, the model shows six most relevant signals to make the Breast Cancer diagnostic (a sensitivity analysis).
